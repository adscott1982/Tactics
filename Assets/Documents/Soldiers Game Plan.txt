Tactics
*******

Top down 2D game. Player plans the movements of 1 or more groups of soldiers in the environment, aiming to eliminate enemies and satisfy other objectives.

All planning is performed and then the level is started. The player can put in place triggers that may affect one or more of the soldiers.

Ideas
*****

- Triggers, a la Rainbow Six
- Soldier development/promotion
- When a soldier dies, they are permanently dead
- Rewards can be used to level up the soldiers in the group
- Players can assign soldiers to different groups
- Players can assign different loadouts to soldiers
- Levels may have physical items that provide rewards
- Soldiers/people may be recruited during missions
- Levels may be replayed (even after success), up until the point the player chooses to progress
